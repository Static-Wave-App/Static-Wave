 * Artwork shown on the lock screen / Now Playing card.

 * Deliberately a bundled asset rather than `station.favicon`:
 *
 * 1. RadioBrowser favicons are user-submitted and frequently missing, plain
 *    HTTP (blocked by iOS ATS), or dead links.
 * 2. Rapidly updating lock screen metadata with *remote* artwork is a known
 *    iOS crash (expo/expo#44496), and station switching does exactly that.
 *
 * Station artwork still appears in-app via `StationAvatar`, which can fall
 * back to initials safely. The lock screen gets something that always works.
